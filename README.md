# Car-Rental-System
Car Rental System Project – Core Java & OOPs

Project Description

The Car Rental System is a basic Java-based application developed using Core Java and follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) principles. This project provides a simple and efficient way to manage car rentals, allowing users to rent cars, return them, and view available vehicles.

Key Features

1. User Authentication – Allows users to log in and access rental services securely.


2. Car Management – Admin can add, remove, or update car details like model, price, and availability.


3. Car Booking & Return – Users can rent a car, and once returned, the system updates the availability status.


4. OOPs Concepts Used:

Encapsulation: Data hiding is implemented using private variables and getter/setter methods.

Abstraction: Interfaces and abstract classes are used to define essential functionalities.

Inheritance: Different types of users (Admin, Customer) inherit common properties from a parent class.

Polymorphism: Methods like displayCarDetails() are overridden for different types of cars.



5. Basic File Handling (Optional) – Data is stored in files instead of databases for simplicity.



Technologies Used

Programming Language: Java (Core Java)

IDE: Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans

Data Storage: File handling (TXT, CSV)


This project is ideal for beginners to understand Java and OOPs while building a practical application. It can be further enhanced by integrating a database and GUI for better user experience.
